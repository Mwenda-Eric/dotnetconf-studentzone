# 🚀Welcome to the .NET Conf Student Zone

## 🌟Overview

The .NET Conf Student Zone is a special “pre-conf” to the main [.NET Conf](https://aka.ms/dotnetconf23-studentzone). The Student Zone is a beginner-friendly event for learners to get started with .NET. Our goal is to welcome beginners to .NET Conf and give learners an exciting entry into the world of C# and .NET. Students will gain exposure to powerful tooling, build engaging projects, and develop a foundation with .NET.

The event is pre-recorded and presenters build a follow-along project using different .NET technologies.

## 👤Who is the .NET Conf Student Zone for?

The .NET Conf Student Zone welcomes learners at any point in their .NET learning journey. Whether you're a total beginner or a seasoned pro, we welcome you to come learn and build with our expert speakers. We anticipate learners will have some basic experience with programming languages prior to attending the event.
